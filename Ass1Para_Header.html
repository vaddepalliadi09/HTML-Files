    <!-- <h1 style="font-size:90px;">Paragraph</h1> 
    <P><b>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.</b> <hr>Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, <em>a paragraph is half a page long,</em> etc. In reality, though, <i>the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</i> <ins>A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit”</ins> <mark>(Lunsford and Connors 116).</mark> <small>Length and appearance do not determine whether a section</small> <ins>in a paper is a paragraph.</ins> <sub>For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles,</sub> a paragraph can be just one sentence long. <sup>Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea.</sup> In this handout, we will refer to this as the <del>“controlling idea,”</del> because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</P>
    <p><mark>Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.</mark></p>
    <p><sub>The decision about what to put into your paragraphs begins with the germination of a seed of ideas; this “germination process” is better known as brainstorming.</sub> There are many techniques for brainstorming; whichever one you choose, this stage of paragraph development cannot be skipped. <sup>Building paragraphs can be like building a skyscraper: there must be a well-planned foundation that supports what you are building.</sup> Any cracks, inconsistencies, or other corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole paper to crumble.</p>
    <p><b>From the list above, let’s choose “illustration” as our rhetorical purpose. We’ll walk through a 5-step process for building a paragraph that illustrates a point in an argument. For each step there is an explanation and example. Our example paragraph will be about human misconceptions of piranhas.</b></p>
    <p><i>The next movement in paragraph development is an explanation of each example and its relevance to the topic sentence. The explanation should demonstrate the value of the example as evidence to support the major claim, or focus, in your paragraph.</i></p>
    <p><em>Continue the pattern of giving examples and explaining them until all points/examples that the writer deems necessary have been made and explained. NONE of your examples should be left unexplained. You might be able to explain the relationship between the example and the topic sentence in the same sentence which introduced the example. More often, however, you will need to explain that relationship in a separate sentence.</em></p> -->
