    <h1 style="font-size:90px;">Image Processing</h1>
    <p>Image processing is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it. <mark>The image processing system usually treats all images as 2D signals when applying certain</mark> predetermined signal processing methods.</p>
    <p>It alludes to perception. The image sensor's primary function is to collect incoming light, transform it into an electrical signal, measure that signal, and then output it to supporting electronics. It consists of a two-dimensional array of light-sensitive components that convert photons into electrons. Images are captured by equipment like digital cameras using image sensors like CCD and CMOS. Two components are often needed on image sensors to collect digital pictures. The first is an actual tool (sensor) that can detect the energy emitted by the object we want to turn into an image. The second is a digitizer, which transforms a physical sensing device's output into digital form.</p>
